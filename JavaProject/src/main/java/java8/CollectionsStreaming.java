 * Use filter to select elements and map to transform elements.
 * When you process a collection, you usually iterate over its elements and do some
 * work with each of them. For example, suppose we want to count all long words
 * in a book. First, letâ€™s put them into a list:
 * <p>
 * You create a stream.You specify intermediate operations for transforming the initial stream into
 * You apply a terminal operation to produce a result. This operation forces the execution of the lazy operations that precede it. Afterwards, the stream can
 * <p>
 * no longer be used.
